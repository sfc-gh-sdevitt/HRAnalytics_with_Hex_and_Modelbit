## Business Problem :

American healthcare providers are facing serious personnel shortages due to rising attrition rates. This is especially true for the nursing staff who play a pivotal role in delivering the healthcare to the patients at the grass roots. Key challenges in alleviating  this problems are: 

- Timely data on termination history at the organization that can be analyzed to understand reasons for attrition
- External world view, like organizational review data, general sentiment data, to compliment the first party HR data at any organization
- Easy and maintainable mechanisms to build and maintain data pipelines that can present the data in an easy-to-consume form for the leadership to consider while decision making
- Ability to not only understand history of WHATs, but look into future to know WHYs and then HOW-TOs
